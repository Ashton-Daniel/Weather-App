# Weather App

## Description
This program is a simple weather app that can find the temperature and weather of any city worldwide. 

## Installation Instructions
To use this app, download the latest version(Weather App 2.1) and open it. This should run the code in the command console. If this does not work, the code can also be run with any Python-compatible software.

## Usage
### Menus
There are three menus contained within this weather app: The main menu, the weather menu and the location history menu. The main menu is the starting menu, and from the main menu, the two other menus can be accessed through the 'weather' and 'location history' commands, respectively. In the weather menu, if any city is entered, the temperature and weather of that city at the time of input are displayed on the console. In the location history menu, the user's location history from the run-time session can be read or deleted using the 'read' and 'delete' commands.



### Universal Commands
Additionally, there are three commands that can be utilized in any menu: 'help', 'quit' and 'clear'. The help command will give the user a list of commands that can be inputted at that menu. The 'quit' command allows the user to quit the session and can be used at any menu. The 'help' command shows the user a list of the commands that can be accessed in the current menu. The 'clear' command clears the current console.
